## üìç Overview

The project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) implementation of the "Mancala" board game using C++ and Qt framework. The Mancala game logic is encapsulated within numerous classes defining objects such as `Player`, `Marble`, `Pit`, and `Board`. The code allows performing game operations such as game initialization, handling player moves, scoring, and switching player turns involving random manipulation of Marbles-all based on user interactions within the graphical interface.The value proposition of this project is to provide a digitized version of a traditional board game with a useful GUI, reducing the need for physical components. As a tool of educational value, it could assist with understanding object-oriented programming, game logic implementation, user interaction handling, and graphics rendering.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The system has a well-structured architecture, following the MVC pattern, separated in different sections such as classes, GUI using classes like QGraphicsScene, QMainWindow,Player, Store etc for business logic.
| **üìñ Documentation**   | Documentation is lacking which compounds difficulty understanding the purpose and directions behind some classes.
| **üîó Dependencies**    | This project relies heavily on the Qt library for all its GUI aspects (windowing, widgets, graphics, event handling) and standard C++ for core logic.
| **üß© Modularity**      | The system is modular, broken down into distinct classes such as player, pit and marble among others. Architected to be easy to maintain/expand.
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | No explicit testing framework or tests appear in the examined files. Use of testing methodologies is unverifiable in current form.
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | Efficient and fast, given that Qt provides efficiency and speed, and the MVC components interact without overcomplication.
| **üîê Security**        | No signs of security measures or considerations within the codebase. Seems irrelevant due to game nature.
| **üîÄ Version Control** | Git is in use for versioning. Detailed versioning or release strategy is not readily apparent from the provided information.
| **üîå Integrations**    | Their project cleanly integrates with the Qt library. Beyond that, no other apparent service integration exist.
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | Utilizes local Client-Server. Very little elasticity or ability to scale beyond initial size. However, for a GUI based two-player game scalability features might not be needed.|
